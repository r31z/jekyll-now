title: How many ways are there to print "Hello World!" In C/C++?
categories: [Computer Science]

This remind me of this old joke:
    
#### Evolution of a Programmer

High School / Junior High
		
	10 PRINT "HELLO WORLD"
  20 END
      
First Year in College
   program Hello(input, output)
   begin
   writeln('Hello World')
   end.

Senior Year in College

   (defun hello
   (print
   (cons 'Hello (list 'World))))

New professional

    #include
    void main(void)
    {
      char *message[] = {"Hello ", "World"};
      int i;
      for(i = 0; i < 2; ++i)
        printf("%s", message[i]);
      printf("\n");
     }
