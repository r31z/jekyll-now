#### Functions
Next, add the following below your previous JavaScript:	

	 function checkGuess() {
 	 alert('I am a placeholder');
	}
	
Functions are reusable blocks of code that you can write once and run again and again, saving the need to keep repeating code all the time. This is really useful. There are a number of ways to define functions, but for now we'll concentrate on one simple type. Here we have defined a function by using the keyword function, followed by a name, with parentheses put after it. After that we put two curly braces ({ }). Inside the curly braces goes all the code that we want to run whenever we call the function.

The code is run by typing the name of the function followed by the parentheses.
